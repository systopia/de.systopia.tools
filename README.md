# SYSTOPIA CiviCRM Tool Collection

# Tools Provided

1. Task to add large amounts of contacts to a group (in case the CiviCRM task times out)
2. Task to update the greetings of all contacts
3. Task to update the sort- and display names of all contacts
4. API Runner to manually trigger API commands taken from a log, with a rollback if needed. This will probably be moved to the logging extension.
